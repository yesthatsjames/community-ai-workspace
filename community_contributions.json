      "community_purpose": "\n## \ud83c\udfaf Community Data Commons Purpose Statement\n\nThe Community Data Commons exists to ensure that artificial intelligence serves community empowerment rather than extractive corporate interests. We believe that communities should control their own data, their own AI systems, and their own technological futures.\n\n### Our Core Principles:\n- **Community Sovereignty**: Communities maintain complete control over their data and AI systems\n- **Privacy by Design**: All processing happens locally, with zero external data sharing\n- **Grassroots Empowerment**: Technology serves community organizing, not corporate profits  \n- **Federated Collaboration**: Communities share knowledge improvements while maintaining data autonomy\n- **Movement Integration**: AI systems support broader social justice and liberation goals\n            ",
      "governance_framework": "\n## \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f SDI Secretariat Governance Role\n\nThe SDI Secretariat serves as the coordinating body that ensures the Community Data Commons remains true to its community empowerment mission.\n\n### Secretariat Responsibilities:\n1. **Community Representation**: Ensure diverse community voices shape system development\n2. **Ethical Oversight**: Prevent mission drift toward extractive or surveillance applications  \n3. **Technical Standards**: Maintain privacy-preserving, community-controlled architecture\n4. **Movement Alignment**: Connect AI development with broader social justice organizing\n5. **Resource Coordination**: Support communities in accessing technical infrastructure\n6. **Conflict Resolution**: Mediate disputes between communities or technical contributors\n\n### Decision-Making Process:\n- **Community Consensus**: Major decisions require input from participating communities\n- **Technical Transparency**: All code, algorithms, and data processing methods are open source\n- **Regular Review**: Quarterly assessments of system impact and community satisfaction\n- **Adaptive Governance**: Framework evolves based on community needs and feedback\n            ",
      "contribution_guidelines": "\n## \ud83d\udccb Community Contribution Guidelines\n\n### For Communities Contributing Knowledge:\n1. **Informed Consent**: Communities must explicitly consent to knowledge sharing\n2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect indigenous knowledge systems and protocols\n3. **Participant Protection**: All individual identifiers are cryptographically anonymized\n4. **Community Benefit**: Contributions should demonstrably benefit the contributing community\n5. **Revocation Rights**: Communities can withdraw their data at any time\n\n### For Technical Contributors:\n1. **Privacy First**: No contributions that compromise community data sovereignty\n2. **Community Input**: Technical changes require community representative approval\n3. **Open Source**: All code contributions must be publicly auditable\n4. **Movement Alignment**: Technical work should support community organizing goals\n5. **Accessibility**: Systems must be usable by communities with limited technical resources\n\n### For Movement Organizations:\n1. **Solidarity**: Support community data sovereignty as part of broader liberation work\n2. **Resource Sharing**: Share funding, technical expertise, and organizing knowledge\n3. **Cross-Movement Learning**: Connect AI development with other social justice efforts\n4. **Accountability**: Hold the system accountable to grassroots community needs\n5. **Scale Responsibly**: Grow the network without compromising community control\n            ",
